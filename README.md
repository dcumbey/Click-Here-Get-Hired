# Get-Hired
Let's be honest, I'm not a software developer. Github is intimidating and it will take time for me to learn to use so bare with me! While I'm not an expert on coding, I am an expert in the hiring process. 
If you are looking for work or know people that are, email me at drew.cumbey@catapultsg.com or give me a call at 469.281.9338. 
I currently have several remote software engineer roles, senior and entry level. Looking for people that specialize in .Net, Java, Golane, React, etc. 
Work authorization must be: US Citizen, Green Card, GCEAD, TN. Even if you are working, I'd love to have a conversation and see if we can find you better compensation in roles that you prefer. Hit me up!
